# Dual Licensing: GPLv3 (Public) + Commercial

You may use the Latency Reduction Controller (LRC) under one of two licenses:

1. **GPLv3** — strong copyleft. If you incorporate LRC into a larger program and distribute it, that
   program must also be GPLv3. Great for community usage and contributions.
2. **Commercial License** — for companies that need to integrate LRC into closed-source products or avoid
   GPL obligations. Contact [sales@worlddatafilter.com](mailto:sales@worlddatafilter.com).

Contributions are accepted under a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) or Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).
Further contribution policies will be published alongside the CLA/DCO templates.
